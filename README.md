DBCoverflow
===========
## Overview

DBCoverflow is an app for Dev Bootcamp staff, students, and alumni to provide online support to each other in the form of posted questions and answers, as well as comments on each of those questions and/or answers. While the information is available to the public, the ability to post questions, answers, or comments is limited to registered users.

DBCoverflow is similar to [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) in that it provides a persistent repository for technical questions and answers, but slightly different in that its categories for questions will also include areas such as Engineering Empathy, Logistics, etc. Questions and support regarding specific topics and challenges are also encouraged.
